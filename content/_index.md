I am a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Cornell and a member of
the [Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/) lab. **I am currently looking for industry roles. Please reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your team.**

I am primarily interested in Programming Languages, Systems and how they intersect
with Computer Architecture. My research work is focused on
building better tools for simulating and debugging intermediate languages for
hardware design. I aspire to make useful systems and tools that can help
realize the promise of open-source language ecosystems. And, I'm always excited
to hack on different compilers.
