Griffin Berlstein is a PhD student studying computer science at Cornell University. They
graduated from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) in 2019 with a major in
Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. While at Vassar they were advised by the
wonderful [Jason Waterman](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jawaterman/) who thought they
were pretty okay.

They are interested in Programming Languages and Systems and how these areas intersect
with computer architecture. [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) is
their advisor and otherwise party to their shenanigans in
[Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/).

They occasionally write things, academic and otherwise, which can be found in the
sidebar. If you'd like to get in contact with them, please see the tab in the
sidebar.
