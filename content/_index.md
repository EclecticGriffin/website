Griffin Berlstein is a first-year PhD student studying computer science at
Cornell University. They graduated from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/)
in 2019 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. While at
Vassar they were advised by 
[Jason Waterman](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jawaterman/) 
who thought they were pretty okay (probably). They find writing
about themselves in the third person to be awkward and clunky yet get so few
chances to do it that they simply couldn't resist. For this, and nothing else,
they apologize.

Anyway, dropping the third person. I'm broadly interested in PL, Systems, and
Networks and my work thus far has often touched on some aspects of
privacy/security though I consider myself an expert in neither. I am advised by
[Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/). 

I occasionally write things, academic and otherwise, which can be found in the
sidebar.

## News

I don't really know what goes here. My existence, while ongoing, is not
particularly interesting. But since other people have a news section I let the
peer pressure get to me.


#### About this site

I made it using Hugo and the Hyde theme (with a bunch of hacking), if things
look weird, it's almost certainly my fault. Web design is not my forte.
