Griffin Berlstein is a first-year PhD student studying computer science at
Cornell University. Previously they studied at Vassar college from which they
graduated in 2019 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
They find writing about themselves in the third person to be awkward and clunky
yet get so few chances to do it that they simply couldn't resist. For this, and
nothing else, they apologize.

Anyway, I'm broadly interested in Systems and am increasingly being drawn into
the intersection of PL and Networks. I occasionally write things, academic and
otherwise both of which can be found in the sidebar.

## News

I don't really know what goes here. I'm not that interesting, to be honest, but
other people have a news section so I feel morally obligated to have one too


#### About this site

I made it using Hugo and the hyde theme, if things look weird it's probably my
fault. Web design is not my forte.
