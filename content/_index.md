Griffin Berlstein is a second-year PhD student studying computer science at
Cornell University. They graduated from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/)
in 2019 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. While at
Vassar they were advised by
[Jason Waterman](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jawaterman/)
who thought they were pretty okay (probably).

They are interested in PL and Systems and how these areas intersect with computer architecture.
[Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) is their advisor and otherwise party to their shenanigans in [Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/).

I occasionally write things, academic and otherwise, which can be found in the
sidebar. If you'd like to get in contact with me, please see the tab in the

#### About this site

I made it using Hugo and the Hyde theme (with a bunch of hacking), if things
look weird, it's almost certainly my fault. Web design is not my forte.
