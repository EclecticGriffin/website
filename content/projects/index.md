[Calyx][calyx] is an open-source intermediate language for developing custom
hardware accelerators. I built a custom interpreter and gdb-like debugger for
the language, called [Cider][cider]. My more recent work has focused on
extending this tool further with additional analyses to detect hardware-specific
bugs throughout the Calyx ecosystem.

### _Use-based Privacy_

Use-based privacy is an approach which protects data based on how it is used,
rather than just who can access it. For instance, you may wish to share your
location with your co-workers, but only in the form of what room you are in
within your workplace and only during the workday. These types of rich privacy
policies can be implemented using systems such as [Ancile][ancile]!
