&lt;p&gt;If you’ve decided to start an interview or talk-heavy unscripted podcast but
don’t know the first thing about audio, then this little scrawl may be for you.
I’ll take you through a few basics, common pitfalls, and approaches so that your
podcast doesn’t annoy me personally, which I think we can all agree is an
egregious offense. I am, of course, far from an expert on audio engineering and
recommend you seek out more authoritative resources for deeper insights and
tooling tips.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post, I am specifically concerned with interview-style
podcasts or those featuring a fair bit of unscripted talking, of which there are
many examples. I am not considering podcasts with a video component, as they
introduce more constraints on editing, nor those which are generally not edited
such as those that are livestreams first and foremost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are particular topics you are interested in, feel free to skip around
using this table of contents. I won’t be mad, I promise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-is-this-for&quot;&gt;Who is this for&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I said up top that this post is about podcasts and the editing thereof,
which is not untrue, but it might be more accurate to say that this is really
about audio-centric mediums. While my particular focus is on one
realization of this, I’m hopeful that a fair bit of it should generalize to
other domains, including those which are not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; audio. With that in mind, lets
dive into it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;recording&quot;&gt;Recording&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can edit, you need to record your audio in the first place. How you
choose to record things will heavily impact your end quality. And while good
editing can do a lot, audio is sometimes unsalvageable regardless of fancy
microphones and recording equipment. Chances are you already have everything you
need to record decent audio already!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-need&quot;&gt;What You Need&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a &lt;strong&gt;microphone&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and some &lt;strong&gt;device&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, probably a computer, on which to
record your audio. Owing to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE EVENT&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, you likely have some setup already
for video conferencing whose microphone is perfectly functional.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;microphones&quot;&gt;Microphones&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of microphones out there in the world and consequently it is easy
to get overwhelmed in analysis. Fortunately for most uses, you don’t need a
super high end studio microphone, but that said there are still ones you will
want to stay away from.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their availability may make them tempting, laptop microphones and those
embedded in webcams should usually be avoided. They frequently are not of
particularly good quality and are nearly impossible to position in the right
way. Similarly, headset microphones, while a step up from laptop mics, are also
usually not the best in terms of sound quality, plus their positioning usually
makes your breath go straight into the microphone which sounds terrible and only
gets worse when plosives are considered. Thus, in general, if one is able it is
better to use some form of external microphone separate from both your device
and your headphones. This also means one thing breaking won’t require you to
replace all your equipment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking there are two catagories of microphones to consider based on
their connection mechanism: USB and XLR. The former is what you’re most likely
to find when initially searching and are generally pretty plug-and-play. If you
don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; an XLR mic, probably just go with a USB. The downside of USB mics
is that you usually have a bit less control of the signal processing since it
happens all internally. The tradeoff for XLR microphones moves in the opposite
direction where you get more control of the signal, for instance the ability to
use inline preamps and manually set the gain, but it requires additional
hardware, namely a preamp and an audio interface, though frequently the audio
interface can also act as a preamp. The basic job of a preamp is to amplify the
signal provided by the microphone to usable levels with the amount of
amplification being called the &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—there are other qualities of preamps
that people care about, but I won’t get into those here. Audio interfaces on the
the other hand are how analog signals, such as those produced by a microphone,
are turned into digital signals which we can process in an audio editor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are you don’t need a bunch of fancy audio equipment, so just stick to a
nice USB microphone until that need changes. There are plenty of budget &amp;amp; travel
friendly options out there that will more than meet your needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;capture-patterns&quot;&gt;Capture patterns&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay this really gets into the weeds, but for those interested, you might be
wondering why a bunch of mics say “cardioid” and what that means. In this case
it refers to the &lt;em&gt;capture pattern&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the microphone which is the shape of the
region around the microphone in which it can pick up sound. There are a number
of different patterns, and some mics allow more than one, with cardioid patterns
tend to be the most common. In this case, the microphone picks up sound in a
heart-shaped region, hence the name, with most of the pickup being in front of
the mic with the region tailing off around the sides and back. These microphones
are good for most uses, but can pick up a fair bit of background noise which
distinguishes them from more directional microphones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other patterns of potential interest are bidirectional mics, which pick up
sound on both the front and back of the microphone with less on the sides, and
omnidirectional mics which pick up sound equally in all directions. Probably
don’t worry too much about this and just go with a cardioid microphone unless
you specifically need something different, like a bidirectional mic for
interviews in the same room. For those curious, Wikipedia has a
&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microphone#Polar_patterns&quot;&gt;good breakdown&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
on both these and other patterns that I did not discuss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-options&quot;&gt;Other Options&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ideally one will have a separate microphone, it is also possible to use a
phone held upside-down as a microphone. The quality of the result will vary
depending on the phone and what type of access it gives you to the microphone,
but the results can be shockingly good sometimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;devices&quot;&gt;Devices&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the job of the microphone is to capture audio, the job of your other
device is to store it. Usually this is just the computer&#x2F;phone being recorded
into but other dedicated recorders exist such as those made by
&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoomcorp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;handheld-recorders&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (no, not that one).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you are using, it is crucial that you are &lt;em&gt;directly recording&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the
microphone’s input. For computers, you can use the free software &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audacityteam.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to do
this. For phones, use some audio recording app that allows you to move the sound
file off the device. For programs&#x2F;software that dumps directly to a file, be
sure that it is recording to an &lt;em&gt;uncompressed or lossless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; file format such as
.wav (generally uncompressed) or .flac (lossless compression) rather than lossy
compressed formats such as mp3. Since your final audio will most likely be
distributed in a lossy compressed format, using lossy raw audio can degrade
quality and introduce artifacts, analogous to image “deep frying”, though
whether or not this poses an issue depends on your objectives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-remote-recordings&quot;&gt;For Remote Recordings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where at least one or more participants are remote, you will need
to be communicating over some form of video&#x2F;audio call. &lt;strong&gt;Every member (or
device) must record their local audio separately.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; A voice call may be recorded
as a backup, but in most cases this should not be your primary audio track as
speakers will not be separated and ang network artifacts and glitches will be
preserved in the track. This is the most common mistake I see and it makes for
terrible audio. So if you take nothing else away from this: please please please
don’t record a zoom call.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason people don’t have separate recording tracks for each participant
is that it requires everyone to have some willingness or technical skill which
is not always practical, particularly when conducting an interview. In such
cases there are tools such as &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zencastr.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zencastr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craig.chat&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Craig
Discord Bot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which can help, though they are not without
tradeoffs and limitations. If no such tool works and local recordings are not an
option for some participants, using a recorded audio-call can suffice for that
participant, but to the maximum extent possible you want separate locally
recorded audio tracks for every participant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-in-person-recordings&quot;&gt;For In-Person Recordings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the same rules apply for recording in a single shared space. In general,
it is best to have a separate microphone on every participant with the added
caveat that microphones should be configured such that minimal noise from the
other participants. Of course this requires a fair bit of equipment and is not
always practical, especially given that it requires more robust mixing equipment
than most people will have on hand. If you only have one microphone available
then try to position all speakers at around the same distance from the mic, this
is likely to be uncomfortable for highly directional microphones but can work
well for omnidirection microphones. Be sure that you do a sound check before
recording and avoid moving too far away from the mic to avoid dropoff and
otherwise bad sound.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;microphone-positioning&quot;&gt;Microphone Positioning&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you’ll have some sort of stand you can place the microphone on&#x2F;in. These
can come with the microphone, be a separate mounted arm, or be assembled out of
loose cardboard and books, whatever works. Bonus points if the stand&#x2F;mount
provides some sort of impact isolation! Now here’s the critical part, once you
have the microphone set up and have done your sound check, try to avoid touching
it. In more video driven platforms, it can be really common to see people
holding or constantly re-adjusting the microphone, you generally want to avoid
this as it creates a bunch of noise you will have to edit out, and if you don’t
edit it out I will personally be sad at you. If you’re using a phone as a
microphone or otherwise don’t have a stand and have to hold it, try to avoid
shifting hands too much and avoid touching near the top of the mic unless
you’re trying to do ASMR.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a lav mic, it belongs clipped to your shirt. It is not for holding
please I beg of you. You also want to be careful to avoid ruffling the lav mic
too much as that will also create really unpleasant noises.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other microphones, you want to position yourself about a handspan away from
the microphone if possible. The fun memory device that I usually hear for this
is to make the “hang loose”&#x2F;shaka hand sign and place the pinky right in front
of the microphone and the thumb where your mouth is going to be. You’ll note
this is pretty close! It can take some getting used to and you may end up
drifting further away from the microphone without realizing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also wish to position the microphone at a slight angle to you that
you’re speaking past it rather than directly into the microphone. This can help
avoid plosives causing you to blow air directly into the mic, but you will need
to take some care that you are still audible and aren’t drifting too far out of
the main audio pickup region. If you don’t have pop-filter and are having
trouble with wind noises, you can DIY one by putting a sock or some other fabric
over the microphone, as long as you don’t move it during the recording.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;soundcheck&quot;&gt;Soundcheck&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However you choose to set up the microphone, ensure it is comfortable enough for
the length of your recording session and do your sound check with the volume and
positioning you expect to use for your actual recording. To do a soundcheck,
either directly monitor your microphone, if possible, or record to a file while
you talk in a normal tone of voice for your audio. An easy way to do this is to
just explain something quickly, like what you ate for breakfast, to the
microphone or the other people. The goal here is simply to make sure that things
sound right, which is why what you say for your soundtrack should be in your
normal recording voice and range, whatever that means for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my days of operating the high-school theater sound system, we would
occasionally run into issues if the actors did their sound check differently
from the lines&#x2F;songs delivered during the rest of the show, usually causing me
to frantically adjust things on the fly to avoid clipping and feedback. With any
luck feedback won’t be an issue for podcast recording but if you set your
microphone &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; too high because your soundcheck was quiet, you will end up
clipping the microphone when you get loud, causing your voice to be cut off in a
very noticeable way. If you do the opposite then your audio could be too quiet to
pick up, and some of it may be lost or drowned out by other noise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;room-tone&quot;&gt;Room tone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re ready to record, there’s one more thing to do before getting to the
actual context of the episode: record some room tone. This is just recording the
sound of the room you’re in without actually speaking and is surprisingly
important for later editing. This is also called “presence” in some contexts and
is the unique background noise of a particular microphone position and
configuration on the particular day of the recording. The reason you want a
sample of this is to use when “silence” is needed on a track since true silence
sounds anywhere from ambiguously wrong to like your sound system has broken.
Think of the difference between a phone call where no one is speaking and a dead
line. The difference matters here! Humans are sometimes—emphasis on
sometimes—surprisingly good at telling when certain things sound wrong, for
instance, most people can &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;05&#x2F;328842704&#x2F;what-does-cold-sound-like&quot;&gt;reliably disambiguate the sound of hot water and cold
water being poured into a
glass&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digressions aside, all you need to do is leave a few seconds of silence at the
beginning of your recording to use later as needed. And yes, everyone should do
this as each of the recording setups will have their own different room tone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-digression-on-rooms-and-the-treatment-thereof&quot;&gt;A Digression on Rooms and the Treatment Thereof&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space you are in can affect the sound you record more than your actual
microphone. Unfortunately, few of us have direct access to a treated
space—those which have some form of alterations, often acoustic foam or
panels, to alter their sound profile—so we tend to have to make do with what
we have available. There are lots of reasons people treat a space, but most
commonly it is done to reduce echo. If echo is a problem, there are a few things
you can do to achieve more of a “dead” space. These range from practical and
expensive, like putting foam on the wall, to unhinged yet effective, like
recording inside your closet—literally, the hanging clothes do a good job of
blocking sound reflection. Most typically people try to put up some fabric, or
create a DIY sound shield around their microphone. Cardboard can also be used to
make some DIY sound panels by aligning the corrugations perpendicular to the
wall&#x2F;aligned with the sound source. Some people also just hang curtains around
their desk from a collapsible lattice made of PVC piping. There are a lot of
options! But best not to seek them out until it becomes a problem since
treatment efforts can easily become a Serious Project™️.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;editing&quot;&gt;Editing&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on the whole I’ll have a bit less to say on this part, not because editing is
simple but because it is such a deep area that I can’t possibly cover it in
robust detail and because my knowledge is limited to the particular types of
audio editing I have done in the past, namely straightforward interview and
voiceover. For more complex editing like one might find in audio fiction, you’d
be better off consulting an audio engineer!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-edit&quot;&gt;Why Edit?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing, broadly speaking, is the process by which we take our raw audio and
alter it to best meet our goals for whatever it is we’re making. And in my mind,
there are a few salient reasons to edit (though this list is highly subjective
and non-exhaustive).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-to-make-it-good&quot;&gt;1. To make it good&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw audio, like a rough draft, is seldom exactly what we want for our end
product. In this view, editing is the process of refining what we have until it
is good enough, with both this judgement and process being dependent on your own
goals and taste. You can lose a lot of time here if you are a perfectionist; I
know I do. I don’t have good advice for recognizing when to stop polishing
something, save that done and okay is better than perfect and unfinished.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-to-respect-people-s-time&quot;&gt;2. To respect people’s time&lt;a name=&quot;2-to-respect-peoples-time&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unscripted podcasts&#x2F;audio, there can be a lot of functionally “dead” audio.
Jokes that didn’t land, long pauses, mumbling, starting and stopping, and all
other manner of things that aren’t “useful” for the end product. In this view,
the goal is to keep in only what you deem suits your objective and to cut out
everything that isn’t essential. People’s time is limited and when able, we
should strive to make things only as long as they need to be. This is a deeply
subjective judgement and, like the prior point, needs to be constrained by
practicality. You needn’t eliminate &lt;em&gt;every&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; pause and “um” in the tape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-to-present-people-and-ideas-clearly&quot;&gt;3. To present people and ideas clearly&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context I am thinking specifically about interviews and discussions, so
it is analogous to the first reason but in the opposite direction. Here the goal
is to present the other people and their ideas in the most cogent light. This
can mean a lot of things, such as reordering questions to form a clearer
narrative, cutting out unnecessary digressions in their responses, or
removing long pauses, voiced or otherwise. The potential hazard here is that
you don’t want to mis-represent someone, either in their ideas or their
“essence”, and it is possible to get carried away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-edit&quot;&gt;What to edit?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want to edit depends a lot on your goals. If you are attempting to
condense an hour long interview into thirty minutes, you are going to have to
spend a fair bit of time deciding what parts are important and what you want to
communicate. If you are producing a comedy show, you’ll want to consider what
jokes worked and didn’t as well as their deliveries. If you’re producing a
conversational podcast or a lecture, you may only care about removing background
noise, and excessive voiced pauses (“ums”, “ers”, and the like) but not alter or
remove large chunks of the tape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general editing audio takes far more time than you would expect, assuming you
are not regularly editing audio. A decent lower bound for basic edits is that it
will take you about four times as long as the actual audio segment to edit it.
This gets even longer for more complex edits or those where you’re trying to
compress an hour interview into a 30 minute episode. So budget more time than
you think you need and be sure to use a variety of headphones to ensure things
are at least listenable across different devices. If there are general trends
toward audio normalization in your space, try to match whatever normalization
target is appropriate to avoid swings in loudness across different podcasts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to balance your goals with the amount of time you have for editing.
If you don’t have the time to carefully go through the whole tape and you still
want to release it, you may best benefit from just removing long pauses which
can easily be identified on the visualization. Another option is to make notes
of timestamps while recording which require edits and then only editing those,
there are plenty of programs that make this noting a single button press.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some editing is generally better than no editing!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;editing-software&quot;&gt;Editing Software&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of options here ranging from free to
dear-god-adobe-wants-how-much??? If you don’t have a lot of complex edits to do
you can get by just fine on &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audacityteam.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and if you are willing to spend
some money, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reaper.fm&#x2F;&quot;&gt;REAPER&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will more than handle your needs without breaking
the bank. There are other more expensive and specialized pieces of software, but
only seek them out if you need them and, in general, support things that don’t
require an eternal subscription to use, when possible. Learning new software has
a fairly high cost, so most people tend to pick one thing and stick with it
until it creates problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each of these programs, there are copious numbers of free tutorials
available online as well as documentation. These things can be unintuitive, so I
strongly encourage you to look things up! There’s a lot of info out there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;noise-removal&quot;&gt;Noise Removal&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that the most common non-trivial thing you’ll want to do is remove
background noise. There are a number of ways to approach this. There are plenty
of free tools and plugins such as &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audacityteam.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which can work on &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manual.audacityteam.org&#x2F;man&#x2F;noise_reduction.html&quot;&gt;some
background noise&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.izotope.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;iZotope&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; also has a suite of editing plugins which
can be very helpful if you’re willing to pay for them, and, while many are
prohibitively expensive, the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.izotope.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;elements-suite.html&quot;&gt;Elements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; suite tends to go on
sale regularly and meets most of the basic needs you might have. Ultimately what
you need for this depends a lot on what type of background noise you’re dealing
with and what options you have to treat your recording space and your overall
budget. You can get pretty far without needing to pay for anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get out there and make stuff!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://griffinberlste.in/blog/2024-02-20-first-project/">&lt;p&gt;This is the story of my first real research project and why I regret working on
it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became involved in research via an REU (Research Experience for
Undergraduates) in the summer after my sophomore year. While I learned a lot
from the experience, a good deal of it wasn’t positive: I learned the taste of
burnout, the ways in which my brain splits apart under extensive stress and
sleep deprivation, and, crucially, that a project’s societal impact and ethical
ramifications require deep consideration rather than simple good intentions.
This last point did not properly sink in until some time later, but it’s what I
want to talk about today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My involvement with the project only lasted for 10 weeks or so and as a
stressed-and-depressed—albeit undiagnosed at the time—undergrad alone in an
unfamiliar city, I hardly made major contributions in a research sense. This is
not to say I did not do work, if anything the experience taught me to question
what drove me to sacrifice my health and wellbeing to meet unreasonable
expectations, but that most of what I did was data scraping, processing, and
visualization, rather than “deep research work”. But I was an undergrad just
getting started with research so this was all to be expected. Yet even given all
this, I still feel a great deal of guilt around this project because I now
believe it to have been asking the wrong question and potentially harmful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevator pitch for the REU project ended up being quite simple. When
clustering data, a simple and straightforward choice is using the K-Means
algorithm. Simply put in how many clusters you’d like to find and let the
computer do the rest. K-Means works by selecting a number of centroids equal to
the number of desired clusters, organizing the data by nearest centroid, and
finally recomputing the centroids for the new clusters. The process repeats
iteratively until convergence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis of this project was that people don’t often alter the default
settings for the algorithm, like the desired number of clusters and
initialization parameters, and as such could be producing “wrong”
clusters—wrongness here is a somewhat subjective quality—depending on their
choices or lack thereof. In particular, the project focused on the distance
metric used in the algorithm which in most cases defaults to euclidean distance,
i.e., a straight line between two points. This is a reasonable choice for many
categories of data but is not suitable for data which represents points on the
Earth. Believe it or not, the Earth is a sphere so using euclidean distance
instead of a geodesic method—one which accounts for the curvature of the
earth—can produce different results if the data points occur over a large
enough space, like say that of a city.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, it seems reasonable right? Simply some concern about the accuracy of
clustering algorithms under certain circumstances, nothing too sinister no? I’m
sure a few of you can see where this is going. Unfortunately the data whose
clusters I was comparing was crime data from the city the REU was taking place
in, since it was readily available online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that—much to my horror—the project was effectively about
“improving” predictive policing. At the time, I didn’t entirely see the problem
in this since wouldn’t it be better if the clusters were “more accurate”?
Suppose that there are two clusters, &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, in our data. &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is considered
&lt;em&gt;low-risk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is considered &lt;em&gt;high-risk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. If the clusters change based on the
choice of distance metric then some people could be moved from &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; or
vice-versa.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the argument goes that if the “correct” cluster for some over-policed
populations was &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, then you could say that the euclidean
clustering has the potential to cause harm to that population and is thus
biased. We can then attempt to quantify the “bias potential” based on the
percentage of such communities that were “misclassified” between the two cluster
maps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, this reasoning can also cut the other direction and could just as
easily suggest that communities of marginalized people were under-policed, i.e.,
moving people from &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. So ultimately the argument would simply have
to be that the clusters produced with euclidean distance are wrong in their
essence, rather than impact, and geodesic distance should be used instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the end result is something that at best changes very little, and
at worse grants legitimacy to the police and the practice of predictive
policing, which we know to be deeply flawed and structurally racist. Technology
is inherently political. If you work with the police, if you give them better
tools, or suggest improvements to their practices, then you are aiding a deeply
cruel and fundamentally racist organization designed to mete out violence on the
populace. And that should be unacceptable to you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am extremely thankful that my time with the project was limited and that my
work likely had little to do with future efforts&#x2F;impacts. And to the best of my
knowledge, there wasn’t major adoption of the work. But it still haunts me and
acts as a warning going forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, as I see it, was asking the wrong question. While there may be
answers to “Can the choice of distance metric alter data clustering on
geographic data? What about if we cluster crime data? Would this impact
clustering on over-policed communities?” The question tacitly accepts the
practice of predictive policing and the role of the police, neither of which we
should find acceptable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers, particularly graduate ones, it can be easy to forget the many
chains of obligation and interest binding us. The day to day is mostly doing
the, often esoteric, work of research doing whatever needs doing at that
particular moment. In this environment, it can be easy to view our work as being
science for science’s sake. Grandiosely expanding the horizon of humanity’s
knowledge and building the tools of the future. If only that were true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly there is no such thing. We have limited influence on how our tools are
used once placed into the world. Worse still, someone is paying for our research
and not on a whim. They are wagering that our work might produce something
useful to them. And regardless of how long our odds may be, mapping of dead-ends
is not without benefit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we are left with a paralyzing state of affairs. We cannot control what we
unleash into the world and neither do we know what the true motivation of our
funding is—for it is naive to believe that their interest is simply spelled
out in the grant wording. All we can consider is how tools might be used and
whether or not it is good for them to exist. This is, for lack of a better term,
the toolmaker’s dilemma. How do we balance these things? Is doing so even
possible with our limited foresight? How do we know if we are asking the wrong
questions?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to illustrate this with one more example. Let’s imagine that you work
on formal verification. Bugs are bad so it would seem good to find ways of
making sure they are absent; what’s not to like? Further imagine that you are
tasked with formally verifying and hardening an embedded operating system.
Specifically, this operating system is used in vehicles and your task is to make
these vehicles harder to hack. Oh, and you’re being funded by DARPA and the
vehicle is a semi-autonomous helicopter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be tempting to go “yay hack-proof helicopter” and move on with your day
but doing so skirts the recognition of the danger underneath. The above
hypothetical is of course, entirely real and part of the HACMS project. And, in
my opinion, it is nothing short of horrific.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the problem? Well, let’s ask ourselves, why might DARPA—and the
military more broadly—be interested in hack-proof helicopters, really
hack-proof drones? The answer is pretty troubling. The HACMS project stands for
High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems. In short: weapons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has, in all likelihood, been used in drones that kill people abroad
and enable continued war crimes. This work could have helped improve systems
that massacre civilians. Even if it hasn’t—which we will never know for
sure—this possibility should horrify you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the members of this project should bear the
responsibility for the military’s actions, but nor does it release them from
culpability. &lt;em&gt;If you help make or improve weapons then you do not get to turn
away from the consequences, however many steps removed you are.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; All software, I
fear, suffers from this problem far more than we realize. Like it or not, we are
irrevocably connected with one another. Our decisions ripple outward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final example: Github contracts with ICE. Many of us use Github to develop our
tools, to do our research, to hopefully improve the world with our work. Does
that mean we are supporting the atrocities ICE commits by continuing to use
Github and in doing so maintaining its dominance in the space? This problem
exists for all major platforms and most tech companies: Facebook subverts
democracy, Amazon abuses workers and hosts a significant portion of the
internet, not all of which can be said to be good, and there are no shortages of
things to lambast Google over. And that is just what we, the public, happen to
know about. We can be nearly certain that there are plenty of backroom deals we
would find equally, if not more troubling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the common adage that “There is no ethical consumption under
capitalism” which I often see misused with the implied follow-on: “so I’ll just
do whatever”. Rather, I think it is the recognition that we are tied up in
oppressive systems beyond our control which we, as individuals, cannot topple
alone nor fully divest from. But that does not absolve us of responsibility. In
our shared humanity, &lt;em&gt;we are obligated&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to consider our impacts on the world.
This applies all the more for the tools we make and the institutions we support.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the risk of being labeled a hyperbolic bleeding heart, let me say this:
these are the stakes. If you do not consider how the tools you make will be
used, you will ultimately aid in the killing of others. In the subjugation of
others. In the perpetuation of systems of oppression that bind us all. You will,
in your ignorance, sharpen the teeth of monsters or, worse still, teach them to
wield fire.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had some words of hope or advice to end on. But computers are
ultimately tools, and we too can use tools to make things better. I hope we do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an attempt to process the death of a friend&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried and failed to write this post many times. But making sense of death is hard, all the more so in an American culture which abhors the discussion of what waits for us all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend my friend, colleague, and labmate &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20240107010800&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;priyasrikumar.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Priya Srikumar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; died in a car accident. Putting my grief into words is an impossible task but I’ll try to capture what I can and attempt to convey, however imperfectly, the ways in which they touched my life. My friend Rachit has put together a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachit.pl&#x2F;post&#x2F;priya&#x2F;&quot;&gt;memorial&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; post for Priya which I encourage you to read and contribute to if you knew them. This will be like that, albeit messier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself lingering on—and shedding tears over—the small things most. By and large, knowing someone means sharing a lot of minor moments—inconsequential enough to be omitted from synopses yet, large enough in their multiplicity to encompass the entire thing. In remembering Priya, I’d like to share some of these moments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Priya in my first year of grad school first in the programming languages discussion group and then later as their TA for the compilers course. I think they were more motivated in that course than I have ever been in my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the beginning of the pandemic I started a science fiction book club over Zoom as a way to keep people more directly in contact. Priya, still an undergrad, attended some of these meetings and I got to know them better through literary analysis. I remain impressed that they broke past the awkwardness of being the only undergrad in the (zoom) room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in their PhD career we caught up over brunch in the local cat cafe, discussing research project, managing motivation, and the fact that it seems mathematically impossible to read Enough Papers™️. Priya wasn’t 100% satisfied with how things were going and we spent some time talking about how to know if your current advisor is a good fit and what my experience of switching advisors was like. The conversation continued into the cat room. I highly recommend talking to your friends while playing with cats, it adds a natural bit of levity to heavy conversations and it’s easy to take pauses to look at the cats being silly-little-guys.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their transition to our lab, Capra, I got to be the one to add them to the Capra Slack and was privileged to do some pair programming with them. After their first Calyx meeting, they asked me if they’d done alright. Priya was concerned that they had asked too many questions and derailed the meeting. I assured them that it was not uncommon for us to not get through the entire agenda and that it was good for them to ask questions. Priya was very good at asking the right questions to get to the heart of a problem or thing they weren’t understanding. This was an incredible talent that I have yet to develop and I think this, along with their curiosity, made them a wonderful and undoubtedly talented researcher. To say that there is a hole in my heart and the lab is a gross understatement. It is so unfair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of our pair programming sessions, I introduced Priya to some of the tools I liked working with and how I setup my machine. It is always nice to show people things that they will find useful. We talked about my preference to have sidebars on the right side of screens, rather than the more typical left, which I justified by my left &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ocular_dominance&quot;&gt;eye dominance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As it turns out, Priya was also left eye dominant, rather than the more common right eye. They adopted my sidebar preference later too, though I should stress that this is &lt;em&gt;preference&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which I pretend justify with eye dominance because it’s a cool fact that a lot of people don’t seem to know about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time we saw each other in person was during ASPLOS ’23 in March of this year. We were rooming together in the hotel but because of my wretched luck with travel plans meant that I awkwardly had to sneak into the room after midnight. I collapsed almost immediately but fortunately didn’t wake them up; I did however neglect to set an alarm. Priya let me sleep which was the objectively correct choice given my exhaustion. In the room, we’d chit-chat about random things and they gave me last minute notes on my presentation visuals. And although Rachit has already said it, it merits repeating: Priya was disturbingly good at networking, far better than I could ever hope to be. It was truly impressive watching them interact with people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had breakfast together at a restaurant on the last day of the conference. Part of their meal was an absurdly decadent hot chocolate that only a restaurant can really justify. I find it deeply troubling that I have a photo of that hot chocolate but not of them from that trip.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last real conversation was on Zoom near the beginning of August. It was painfully normal—neither of us aware that it would be our last, though we would see each other over Zoom briefly during a later lab status meeting—and we mostly caught up and discussed the semester to come. They were undecided between taking a semester off for an internship or continuing on their current research during the semester. I helped them sort through the pros and cons as I saw them but didn’t put my finger on the scale. A cruel part of my brain wonders if things would be different had I, for some reason, pushed them away from the internship.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many many things that I could try to include, but it is impossible to distill an entire relationship into a set of moments and individual scenes easily understood. This leaves out many discussions over text and in-person about music, video games, and our shared desire to create art outside of our research. This leaves out many tears, hugs, meals, and whispered assurances that things will be okay. This leaves out the experience of seeing them laugh, smile, and their intense enthusiasm. Would that I could convey it all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, reader, take one thing away from my scrawl let it be this: Priya existed, mattered, was cherished by many, and is dearly missed by myself and many others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye Priya. May your memory be a blessing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
