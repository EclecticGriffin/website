  <p>A meander about how to learn to code, or write, or do anything really. As much a
message to myself as anyone else.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr />
<p>So I am fortunate enough to write a fair bit of code in the course of my
research. Over the past several years this has primarily taken the form of Rust,
a language I really like but that has a reputation for being difficult to pick
up. This blog post isn’t really going to be about learning Rust so much as it is
about learning to do creative tasks generally.</p>
<p>Like many people I suffer from a bad case of perfectionist brain gremlins, which
can make it very hard to get things done. They’ve a paralytic effect that can be
hard to manage, particularly in the early stages of things. Writing words, the
thing I am doing now, is a real pain point. The complicated, messy process of
taking ideas from the churning mass of thought-soup that is the conscious and
pinning them down with language is something I become easily frustrated by. This
frustration stems entirely from the recognition that what I’ve made, that what
sits in front of me, is not what I want it to be. Either it’s missing some
essential truth, feels self-indulgent, requires foreknowledge not contained
within the writing, or one of many other unavoidable imperfections of existence.</p>
<p>There’s no getting away from this. No matter what you’ve made, it can almost
always be improved in some way, even if you’re the only one who would notice.
And caving in to this desire to polish, to improve, is a fantastic way to get
nothing done at all, or to never even start. The most perfect version of a thing
is the imagined idea of it; and unfortunately that version will never and can
never actually exist in the world.</p>
<p>I say all this because I think the thought patterns that lead me to struggle to
write are similar, if not the same, to those that can lead people to struggle
learning new programming languages. They are certainly the ones that get in my
way at times.</p>
<p>So here’s how I think about it: our brains are lazy—or efficient depending on
your perspective—and tend to be very use-it-or-lose-it about skills. And,
unfortunately, this means you have to do whatever it is you want to learn and
that you’re going to be bad at it, at first. And that, well that sucks, doesn’t
it? I really, really wish that thinking hard about something was enough. But I
suspect that art would be a lot less compelling if that were the case.</p>
<p>Boiled down to its simplest elements, I think the act of creating something, be
it art or code, looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with an idea fragment</li>
<li>Attempt to make it</li>
<li>Assess what was made</li>
<li>Improve until “good enough”</li>
</ol>
<p>And in my experience, my failure mode looks like jumping right to assessing what
I’ve made after the smallest amount of creation. Put another way, it’s easy to
slip on the editor’s hat before the author is done, because making things is,
quite often, challenging. And while good critique is hard, criticism is quite
easy. This looks something like</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with an idea</li>
<li>Make a <em>tiny</em> bit</li>
<li>Review it. Hate it. Why did I make this <em><strong>garbage</strong></em>?</li>
<li>Go browse the web instead</li>
<li>I’ll get to this project later. Totally.</li>
</ol>
<p>But here’s the thing, it’s almost always the case that you don’t <em>really</em>
understand what you’re making until after you’ve finished trying to make the
first version of it. I believe this is true for writing as much for code
development. And until you actually know the shape—not merely the vibe—of
what you’re making, criticism is largely paralytic and insidious in the way it
promises improvement while grinding everything to a halt.</p>
<p>This is starting to sound an awful lot like self help. Gross.</p>
<p>Okay, brass tacks, how do you learn to program rust? Well, in short, I recommend
that you first read at least the beginning of the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust Book</a> and then as soon
as possible start writing some code. Make a tiny project to do whatever silly
thing strikes your fancy. You can try <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">rustlings</a>. You could even <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">follow</a>
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/">some</a> <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html">tutorials</a>.
There are a ton of <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/noxasaxon/7bf5ebf930e281529161e51cd221cf8a">educational resources</a> out there,
and I’m certain some of them will work for your brain.</p>
<p>But remember: you should always actually write the code yourself. It is far too
easy to look at a piece of code and think “yeah I get it” without actually
understanding or retaining it. Incidentally, this is why I think LLMs are an
absolutely terrible tool for learning programming in general, though I will
accept that I trend pretty negative on the topic.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There’s a good chance that stuff you write won’t work correctly, won’t compile,
or will otherwise frustrate you at first. This is okay. You aren’t doing
anything wrong. You need to get down into the weeds and muck and really wrangle
with things to wrap your brain around them. <strong>Unfortunately, you must do the
thing.</strong> But fortunately with code you can run it and see if it works, no
subjective analysis required! Terrible code that works is still code that
works.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> And often that’s the first step to good code that works. And while
technical debt is real, that’s generally not a concern when you’re first
learning a language. Make something first, then worry about making it better.</p>
<p>As for me, I’ll continue to give myself these reminders as I write more
terrible, terrible words.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>At time of writing there’s apparently this new trend called “vibe coding”,
at least in some circles. And at the risk of sounding like an old person
yelling at a cloud, I really worry what damage this is going to have on
people’s skills and, more generally, how LLMs will impede education. I
cannot imagine trusting an LLM to write a full function, let alone entire
modules or programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>And in my experience there is sometimes a strange, perverse satisfaction
to solving a problem in <em>just the worst</em> way possible. More than once, I’ve
called someone over to see the shuddering abomination of logic I’ve somehow
made complete a task. Behold my wretched amalgam: each loop more tangled
than the last, each variable an entropic scream of a dying world, each
iterator a glimpse into a realm of madness. The compiler cannot save you.
Nothing can save you.</p>
